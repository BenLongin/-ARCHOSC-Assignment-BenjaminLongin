    <h1>My name is: Benjamin Longin</h1>
    <h1>I have created the specified folder structure, and have then created a screenshot of them. This was then saved into the Pictures folder, after being pasted into Paint to ensure I can retain quality.<br> I gave it an identifiable name to ensure it could be returned to easily and will not be confused for any later files.</h1>
    <h1>Firstly, I right  clicked on the folder in my Workspace, then selected “Open In Terminal”. Afterwards, I inputted “git init”, creating an empty git repository.</h1>
    <h1>Firstly, I logged into my GitHub account. Then, I clicked on the New button, allowing me to create this repository. I proceeded to fill it in with the specified data, alongside committing the work<br> I made last week to ensure it will remain. </h1>
    <h1>I inputted the requested commands, linking my remote repository to my repository on GitHub. Due to a lack of feedback from the console, I foolishly assumed that I had failed, and so I tried again. <br>However, it then informed me that I had done it correctly, and I continued on to check the status of the repository and programs.</h1>
