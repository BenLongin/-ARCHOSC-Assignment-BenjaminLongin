    <h2>Firstly, i accepted the assingment and was assinged a new Repository. I then pulled the repository into a local file, before manually merging the contents with another folder. Finally, i pushed the files to GitHub with the requested commit message. </h2>
    <h1><img src="Pictures/git%20innit%20one.png" height="40%" width="40%" alt=""></h1>
    <h2>I opened the "Actions" tab, followed by the "Pages" tab. Then, i selected "New Workflow" and "Set Up a Workflow yourself". This allowed me manual control over everything, allowing me to rename "main.yml" to "deployment.yml". </h2>
    <h1><img src="Pictures/git%20innit%20one.png" height="40%" width="40%" alt=""></h1>
    <h2>Then, i implemented the requested YAML code, allowing the Deployment to function without problem. I had to implement it into three major sections, being the Name of the pipeline, the run conditions, then the jobs it performs.</h2>
    <h2>This was started via implementing a "name: Deploy Website" command, naming the action "Deploy Website".Then, i implemented the run condtions via a "On:", "Push:" and "Branches:" , creating a strict formatting that the following code would have to stick to.</h2>
    <h2>Afterwards, i implimented the "jobs:", "projectdeploy:", "runs-on: ubuntu-latest" tree, telling the program to run the action on that specific type of Virtual Machine, enabling it to function. </h2>
    <h2>Following this, i implemented the "steps:" tree of code, followed by a name and use. This pulls from an existing action GitHub action they made, being the checkout action.</h2>
    <h2>Then, i added permissions via the "permissions:" command, allowing me to read and write my repository with the correct token.</h2>
    <h2>After this, i provided the Artifact, being a set of fields the workflow holds to be used repeatedly. I use "with:" to tell GitHub i want to use a specified folder, and "path: ." to tell them to use the whole folder.</h2>
    <h2>Then, i simply use another "uses:" to deploy everything to GitHub pages.</h2>
    <h1><img src="Pictures/git%20innit%20one.png" height="40%" width="40%" alt=""></h1>
    <h2>Finally, i created a new HTML document and created both via a link, using the <"a href"> command to specify the link, and following up the link with the text i want it to have. This allows me to display content on a wider range of space, and grants greater control over my contents display.</a></h2>
